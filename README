1. Introduction
-------------------------------------------------
This is a game client written by Karl Valdimar
at Reykjavik University for a computer graphics
class. It is a simple but fun game that at the
moment is hard-coded to connect to a server of
mine. Feel free to send it to a friend and have
a blast. Any comments and feedback is welcomed,
you can contact me on Facebook or by email,
karlvaldimar@gmail.com


-------------------------------------------------
2. Starting the Game
-------------------------------------------------
Just extract everything from the Zip file and run
GC.jar, just be sure that the assets folder is
at the same location as the Jar file.
The game will ask you for a nickname and once you
press connect it will check if the nickname is
available and if there is space on the server.
Note that the same message will appear if the
nick is in use or if the server is full.


-------------------------------------------------
4. Controls
-------------------------------------------------
W, A, S, D		Move the player
Left Shift		Sprint
Space			Jump
Q				Switch between Gun or box
Left Mouse		Remove a block or shoot the gun
Right Mouse		Place a block
Scroll wheel	Change type of blocks

-------------------------------------------------
4. Gameplay
-------------------------------------------------
When you enter the game you start at a random
location high up in the air, don't worry the drop
won't hurt you! You start with a block in hand and
using the left mouse button you can remove a
block and the right mouse button to add a block.
If you find the block you are placing is ugly you
can use the scroll wheel to change the block type.
At the moment there are 7 different types of
blocks.
If you are approached by a another player and
he is maybe removing the blocks you placed or just
annoying you, you can press Q and switch to your
gun and shoot the bastard! But be careful, you
have only 5 bullets and it takes 4 to kill a
another player. If you find yourself out of ammo
just press R to reload your gun.

5. Known Bugs
-------------------------------------------------
This a very young game and there for it isn't
perfect. Again all points or suggestions are welcomed.
The known bugs are:

*	You can run over some small holes without falling down.
*	The connection is lost but the game keeps running.
*	The player doesn't start with full health after dieing.
